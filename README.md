# Select Project Teams

Data downloaded from Canvas has been formatted into a text file, `projecttopics.txt`, in which each line contains a space separated list of team name and their choices. Team names have been anonymized.

The program in `projectteams.py` reads the text file and computes _pairings_. A pairing consists of pairs of teams whose choices overlap. Multiple pairs can be assigned to a single data structure, but one team can only be assigned to one pair and one data structure.

Contributions in the form of pill requests are welcome.
